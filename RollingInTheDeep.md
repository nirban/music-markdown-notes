[Verse]
 
Am             Em
There's a fire starting in my heart,
G                                Em                       G
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Am             Em
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
G                              Em                     G
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your shit bare
 
Am                      Em
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
G                       Em                    G
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
Am             Em
There's a fire starting in my heart
G                                Em                       G
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
F               G                    Em
   The scars of your love, remind me of us
             F                           G  F
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             G                        Em
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
             E7
I can't help feeling...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                     Am                             G
We could have had it all... (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
               F                           F              G
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (G)                                          Am            G
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           F                                           F                   G
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am              Em
Baby, I have no story to be told,
    G                              Em                        G
But I've heard one on you. Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Am                 Em
Think of me in the depths of your despair
G                          Em                        G
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
F               G                    Em
   The scars of your love, remind me of us. (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
             F                              F
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
             G                        Em
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
             E7
I can't help feeling... (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                     Am                              G
We could have had it all...  (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
               F                           F              G
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (G)                                          Am            G
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           F                                           F                   G
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
 
 
[Interlude]
 
(G)               F     G
Could have had it all
               Am     G
Rolling in the deep
                   F             F
You had my heart inside of your hand
           G                  G
But you played it    with a beating
 
 
[Verse]
 
N.C.
Throw yourself through every open door (Whoa)
 
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Whoa-uh)
Am
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
 
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Am                     G
(You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
                     F                          F              G
We could have had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
   (G)               Am                               G
We could have had it all yeah (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
   F                   F                                         G
It all,   It all,   It all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
 
   (G)               Am                          G
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
               F                           F              G
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (G)                                    Am            G
You had my heart (you're gonna wish you) Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           F                                     F                   G
And you played it (Tears are gonna fall) To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
 
   (G)               Am                          G
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
               F                           F              G
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    (G)                                    Am            G
You had my heart (you're gonna wish you) Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           F                             F
But you played it. You played it. You played it.
       G             Am
You played it to the beat.
